    " Drowsiness detection is a safety technology that can prevent accidents that are caused by drivers who fell asleep while driving.This code can detect your eyes and alert when the user is drowsy. \n",

    "## Applications\n",
    " Driver drowsiness detector using OpenCV, Python, and computer vision techniques. This can be used by riders who tend to drive for a longer period of time that may lead to accidents.\n",

    "### Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Each eye is represented by 6 (x, y)-coordinates, starting at the left-corner of the eye (as if you were looking at the person), and then working clockwise around the eye:.\n",
